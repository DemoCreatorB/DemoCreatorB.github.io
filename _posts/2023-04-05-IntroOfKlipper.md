# What is Klipper?
Klipper is an open-source firmware that allows 3D printers to use a single-board computer (SBC) as their main controller, instead of relying on the printer's native controller. This allows for faster and more precise printing, as well as the ability to easily modify and customize printer settings. With Klipper, users can achieve better print quality and speed while utilizing affordable SBCs like the Raspberry Pi.
